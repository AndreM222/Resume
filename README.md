## About ℹ️

I worked on my  using LaTeX. There are several reasons I have decided to do it
this way instead of using other apps like Word.

- **Reason 1:** Word and other apps tend not to be free and I want to keep it more available in case of emergencies.

- **Reason 2:** I can use the least amount of tinkering using this by setting the values at the beginning, and the
appearance stays the same as changes are made

- **Reason 3:** I was interested on learning LaTeX for a while, out of cursiosity.

## Languages 🗣️
